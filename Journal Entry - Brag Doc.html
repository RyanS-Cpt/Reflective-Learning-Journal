            <h2>Work up until now...</h2>
            <h3>what's happened, did I call it right?</h3>
            <p>Up until this point in my life I have always worked in such a way as to both please others and try to do more than is asked of me,
                not necessarily for recognition, but more for my own knowledge and advcancement in my field and in my skill-set. I have always had 
                the belief that hard-work is generally noticed and rewarded as such, but alas, my experience thus far has been limited and although 
                I have worked in such environments, I am yet to experience such meritocracy. I had this idea that, by now, my drive would have had me 
                in a position where I have both more responsibility and more freedom and enjoy with that the comforts of having my own space and variety 
                in my skill-set resulting in various streams of income.</br>
                Sadly, this has not yet happened and fortunately my journey has lead me to individuals who, have helped me ask the right questions
                and learn the right skills to answer of find answers to them.</br>
                There are many reasons why my hard work was not noticed, either because the efforts I put in were not suited to my personality, the 
                efforts I put in were not noticed and I did not highlight them well enough or what I perceived as hard-work was seen by others as simply
                enough and in fact minimal.

            <h2>My Web Dev Journey...</h2>
            <h3>what has happened so far?</h3>
            <p>One of the major life skills that has come out of my journey thus far, apart from the obvious tech skills that are expected with such a venture 
                is that I need to be clear on my daily and weekly goals and put in the efforts, also, I need to engage and share with my class-mates and
                help when I have the knowledge to do so, also I should make sure I am heard in the group, whether it is a question or just an opinion and 
                lastly, if I want recognition, I need to share my work and experiences and be open to comments and advice.
